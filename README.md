# agile-data-pipeline-azure

Cloud-based data pipeline simulation for a mid-sized e-commerce company using Azure Blob Storage and Python. This project showcases the skills of a Data Engineer: ingesting, cleaning, transforming, and automating data workflows in a simulated cloud environment — with Agile sprint-style delivery.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build an end-to-end data pipeline simulating real-world workflows
- Use Azure Blob Storage for cloud-based data handling
- Apply Agile methodology with backlog and sprint-style tasks
- Automate the ingestion, cleaning, and transformation of e-commerce data
- (Optional) Add Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, os, azure-storage-blob)
- Azure Blob Storage (Simulated S3-style object store)
- Git & GitHub (version control, portfolio)
- (Optional) Power BI for dashboard reporting
- Agile workflow (Sprint Backlog, Tasks, Iteration)

## 📊 Business Questions

- What is the order return rate per product?
- Which customer segments generate the most revenue?
- How many tickets does support process weekly?
- How fast are returns handled on average?

## 🚀 Workflow

### 📦 Sprint 1: Data Preparation
- Generate synthetic CSV files
- Upload them to Azure Blob Storage

### 🔄 Sprint 2: Pipeline Development
- Ingest data from Azure
- Clean and normalize fields
- Create new fields (e.g., return rate, support load)

### 🤖 Sprint 3: Automation
- Build an orchestration script
- Schedule local pipeline with `cron` / Task Scheduler
- Export final datasets to Azure Blob (outputs folder)

### 📊 Sprint 4 (Optional): Dashboard & Reporting
- Visualize key metrics in Power BI
- Export PDF report if needed (same as in Project 1/2)

## ✅ Deliverables

- 💾 Synthetic e-commerce CSV datasets
- ☁️ Upload/download from Azure Blob Storage
- 📜 Python scripts for ingestion, cleaning, transformation
- 🤖 Automation script running the full pipeline
- 📊 (Optional) Power BI dashboard and/or PDF summary
